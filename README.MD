# Ringtail's Dotfile Repo

A personal repo for all my dotfiles and configurations.

# Setup

Clone the github repo to your home directory
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/RadicalRingtail/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
```

Then, navigate to the dotfiles directory and run ``install.sh``
```zsh
cd ~/.dotfiles
/bin/bash install.sh 
``` 

# Disclaimer

A lot of stuff in this repo is still a work in progress, so i wouldn't recommend using it as is right now (this is also implying that someone would actually use this repo, which i highly doubt, but still)
